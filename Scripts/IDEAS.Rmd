## Analyze Survey Data

Start with a detailed analysis of the responses to question CQ19 from
the Eurobarometer survey to identify the specific support levels across
countries. Look for patterns or clusters of countries with similar
levels of support or lack thereof, noting any outliers.

## Country-Level Factors Analysis

To understand the variations in support levels, examine the following
country-level factors:

### Cultural Norms and Societal Views on LGBTI Rights

Assess how cultural norms and societal attitudes towards LGBTI
individuals might influence policy-making and public opinion. This could
include prevailing religious beliefs, traditional values, and historical
attitudes towards gender and sexuality.

### Legal Systems and Policies

Review the legal frameworks in place for transgender rights, including
the process for changing gender markers on official documents. Identify
whether countries have explicit protections against discrimination for
transgender individuals and how these legal protections are implemented
in practice.

### Economic Variables

Consider the economic context, as countries with higher levels of
economic development may have more resources to support transgender
individuals, including healthcare and legal assistance. History
Historical contexts, such as a country's path to democracy, colonial
history, or past human rights records, can influence current societal
attitudes and policies towards marginalized communities.

## Comparative Analysis

Use the data and country-level analysis to perform a comparative
analysis between countries with high levels of support and those with
low levels. Look for correlations between the country-level factors and
the support levels identified in the survey.
